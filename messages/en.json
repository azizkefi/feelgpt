    "What are the best days to visit?": "Want peace and rides without waiting? Come on weekdays, Monday through Thursday is the best option for a calm day. Weekends are livelier, noisier... and more fun too 😄",
    "Can you leave the park and come back later?": "Oh no, unfortunately not... Once you leave, you'll need a new ticket to get back in. Just like roller coasters—you can't ride them backwards 😅",
    "Where are the parks located?": "Two parks, two vibes! 🎡 Carthage Land Hammamet is located in Yasmine Hammamet, Rue de la Médina. And Carthage Land Tunis is at Les Berges du Lac, Avenue Cheikh Zayed. Just follow the sounds of laughter—you can't miss it 😉",
